    <p>
      Each winner cannot request a cash alternative or substitution of the prize.

In order to win the prize, each winner will be required to sign and return to FIFA an Affidavit of Eligibility and Authorisation pursuant to which the relevant Winner will, inter alia, confirm their eligibility to participate in the Contest (the "Affidavit"). If a potential winner is legally considered to be a minor, the prize will be awarded to the minor’s parents or legal guardian, who must sign and return the Affidavit on behalf of the potential winner. Please note that the Affidavit will also require the consent of the potential winner (or the potential winner’s parent or legal guardian, as appropriate) to have FIFA use his or her name, photograph, submitted photograph, likeness, voice, prize information and biographical information for publicity and promotional purposes without further compensation.</p>
  <p>However, if a winner fails to sign and return the requested Affidavit within twenty four (24) hours of being notified that they are a winner;</p>
    <p>the winner shall be disqualified and shall forfeit the opportunity to claim the prize. Thereafter, FIFA shall, in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 4 above, select another winner.
